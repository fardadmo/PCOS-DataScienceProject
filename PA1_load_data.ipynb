There are various factors that contribute to the development of PCOS, including insulin resistance, obesity, and elevated levels of androgen hormones. PCOS is one of the most common causes of female infertility, affecting 6% to 12% (as many as 5 million) of US women of reproductive age.\n","\n","In the context of a Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) dataset, a classification problem involves predicting whether a woman has PCOS or not, based on a set of input variables or features.\n","\n","A regression problem in the context of a PCOS dataset might involve predicting a certain outcome variable based on one or more input variables. A possible regression problem on a PCOS dataset could be predicting the level of certain hormones, such as testosterone or luteinizing hormone, based on various input variables such as BMI, fasting glucose levels, and insulin resistance. The level of these hormones are crucial in identification of a different disease.\n","\n","Overall, regression analysis on a PCOS dataset can be a valuable tool for understanding the relationship between different factors and the development and progression of PCOS, as well as for predicting certain outcomes based on a woman's individual characteristics.\n","\n","**PART 2.2:**\n","\n","A PCOS disease detection machine learning model could be very beneficial both in terms of improving healthcare outcomes and in creating business value. A machine learning model that can accurately detect PCOS could help clinicians to identify the condition earlier, allowing for earlier treatment and management of symptoms. This could improve patient outcomes, reduce the risk of long-term health complications, and potentially reduce healthcare costs.\n","\n","From a business perspective, a PCOS disease detection machine learning model could have several potential applications. For example, it could be integrated into healthcare apps or digital health platforms to offer users a convenient and accessible way to detect PCOS. It could also be used by pharmaceutical companies to develop targeted treatments for PCOS or by insurance companies to identify high-risk patients and offer preventative care.\n","\n","According to CB Insights' Industry Analyst Consensus, the pharmaceutical industry has experienced rapid growth in recent years and is now valued at over $1 trillion. It is anticipated that AI will be key to improving time-consuming and expensive industry tasks like disease detection and drug discovery. Therefore, PCOS disease detection AI model would be targeting a big and impactful industry.\n","\n","In summary, a PCOS disease detection machine learning model could have significant benefits for patients, clinicians, and businesses, and could potentially contribute to improving healthcare outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.\n","\n","This project seems to be a feasible use case since we are working with a reliable dataset with enough samples. In addition, the dataset is tabular and the training time is not as complicated as some other ML models such as computer vision and natural language processing. Despite this, the financial and non-financial benefits of this product are high due to its large impact. However, the accurate estimation of time and cost varies depending on computational resources.\n","\n","**PART 2.3:**\n","\n","Our problem is related to \"prevent\" value area since we are going to predict a disease at the early stages of disease development and prevent it from happening or worsening.\n","\n","**PART 2.4:**\n","\n","After a PCOS disease detection machine learning model produces results, several potential actions may be taken, depending on the specific context and intended use of the model. Here are some examples of actions that may be taken:\n","\n","Confirmatory testing: If the machine learning model identifies a patient as having PCOS, further confirmatory testing may be conducted to ensure that the diagnosis is accurate. This may involve additional blood tests, ultrasounds, or other diagnostic procedures.\n","\n","Early intervention and treatment: If PCOS is detected, early intervention and treatment can be initiated. This may involve lifestyle modifications, such as changes in diet and exercise, and medication to manage symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles or insulin resistance.\n","\n","Referral to a specialist: If a patient is identified as having PCOS, they may be referred to a specialist, such as an endocrinologist or gynecologist, for further evaluation and management.\n","\n","Monitoring and follow-up: Patients with PCOS require ongoing monitoring to assess their response to treatment and identify any potential complications. The machine learning model may be used to monitor the patient's progress over time and adjust treatment as needed.\n","\n","Research and development: If the machine learning model is used in a research context, the results may be used to inform the development of new treatments or interventions for PCOS. For example, the model may be used to identify subgroups of patients who respond particularly well to a particular treatment, or to identify new drug targets.\n","\n","\n","**PART 2.5:**\n","\n","False negative result is more serious because the patient actually has the disease but the model is predicting it as a healthy. \n","\n","For correction we can ask patient to do the monitoring couple of more times and do the camparison.\n","\n","\n","**PART 2.6:**\n","\n","For the classification problem: Our model will be predicting if the patient has the disear or not based on the input features.\n","\n","For the regression problem: Our model will be predicting the levels of hormones based on some of the input features.\n","\n","**PART 2.7:**\n","\n","1. The regulatory requirements of the accuracy of a newly developed diagnosis tool to be implented into the local healthcare system. Specifically speaking, the healthcare rules and guidlines of India should be analyzed before implementing this ML tool in the market because the data is primarily collected from Indian hospitals.\n","2. How can we make this tool accessible to the general public that need it? Investigating the need for developing a mobile or web-based application using this ML model is crucial.\n","\n","\n","**PART 2.8:**\n","\n","Ethical description:\n","Biases:\n","1. Since the data is collected from India, there might be some geographically discriminating bias if the model needs to be deployed in a different region of the world.\n","2. Other biases such as Age, Weight, family history, genetics, may make the training dataset imbalanced and eventually affect the model generalization performance. These biases need to be analyzed beforehand.\n","\n","Red flags:\n","1. Data privacy is very important in this problem. Patient's data should not be made available to the users without patient's consent.\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"nlp_course","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.7.16 (default, Jan 17 2023, 09:28:58) \n[Clang 14.0.6 ]"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"4ebae8e797894060a64fed2c1dedeeb14e4571bc906cd367c742ebce058905ff"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
